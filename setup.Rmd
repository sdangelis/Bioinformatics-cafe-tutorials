title: "Setting up R and Rstudio"
---


before we can run R we need to install it. We'll also install Rstudio
This video shows how to install R and Rstudio on your pc/mac/linux 
[youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by5HyJX6H1I)

If you are on a BCI IT managed windows machine you should be able to install R and R studio 
without needing admin access. A recent version of R studio is available in the software centre 
(downloading R studio from the internet requires admin access)
However, you will need to install R separately as the version on the software centre is not up to date.

Note this tutorial has been designed for R version 4 and higher.

## Introducing Rstudio

RStudio has 4 panels 
 
1. Editor. This is where you write your scripts 
2. Console. This is the command line interface where you can run R code, or where the code you select from the script with ctrl+enter (pc) / cmd+enter (mac) get sent to
3. environment pane. This is where the variables you create during the R session get displayed.
4. fourth pane. This is a panel of many functions, depending on the selected tab it can display the files in the working directory, any plots you produce, a list of packages and an help panel.

Within Rstudio there are 2 ways to interact with R. You can execute code from a script by selecting it and pressing ctrl+enter (pc) / cmd+enter (mac).  
This is the best way as the code you execute remains on the script and you can easily run multiple lines. Or you can type your command directly in the console. 

# Introducing R 

before the first session let's introduce some really basic concepts in R.

## Variables 

To save something in the computing memory we need to assign its value to a variables. 
In R Variables can be assigned using `name <- value`.

for instance we can create a variable to count the amount of apples

```{r}
apples <- 1
```

R variable names must start with a letter but can then have letters, numbers and the speacial characters `.` or `_`

variables  can contain spaces but using SPACES IN VARIABLE NAMES IS A BAD IDEA. 
There are 2 ways to separate words within a name, `SnakeCase` and `camel_case`.
In R the second is normally used. 

This introduces the concept of style, which is how your code looks to someone else.
Style is a subjective matter, see the relevant section in the [reading](reading.Rmd) tab for links to some guides.
Try to find something you like and stick to it. Consistency helps avoid bugs and helps people understand your code.

```{r}
n_samples <- 42
```

Note: R will happily overwrite values in a variable without any warning

```{r}
n_samples <- 1
n_samples <- 2
n_samples 
```
### Listing and Removing Variables

We can remove variables with `rm(variable)`. i.e 
```{r}
rm(apples)
```

Although RStudio will list all variables in the environment panel, we can use ls() to list all the variables in the environment. Notice we have removed apples.
```{r}
ls()
```
combine it with rm to remove everything.
USE THIS WITH CARE

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Data Modes 

Computers store all information in binary form as 0s and 1s. However, the exact way depends of the type of variable, for instance text is stored differently than numbers.
R is a dynamically typed language which means there is no need to specify what type
a variable is -R does a pretty good job at figuring what type each variable is while running your code

There is normally no need to worry about type and chances are this is the most boring part of the workshops. However, as type errors where your code expects a variable of a different type
are very common, understanding how R stores  variables under the hood can save the day. 

Generally speaking variables are of different types:

- characters/strings for text
- int for integers
- floats for real numbers
- Boolean for True/False

These are present - with different variations on the theme - in most if not all programming languages. In the context of R data types are grouped into 4 main data modes, 
confusingly R variables can also have a type:

| Mode | type | content | Example | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| logical | logical | Boolean values or NA | NA |
| numeric | real |real | 1.3 |
| numeric | integer |integer| 1L |

| complex | complex |numbers | i+2i |
| character | character | letters and strings of text | "hello world" |

Note: in R all numbers are real unless we add the `L` suffix to specify an integer 

we can check the mode of a variable using `mode(variable)`
```{r}
mode(1L)
```
and the type with `typeof()`

```{r}
typeof(1L)
```

### Converting types

R often converts or coerce values between types automatically, for instance we can happily remove 0.5 from an integer and get a real number back 

```{r}
1L+0.4
```
We can also explicitly convert between types or cast values with one of the `as.type()` functions

```{r}
as.numeric("3")
```

Of course the value must make sense in the new type, else we get a `NA` which is R way to represent missing values.

```{r}
as.numeric("three")
```

### Characters

R characters contain letters or strings of text are equivalent to what in most languages are called strings and it is common to see R code refer to characters as strings.
To create a character we quote our text with either single '' or double "" quotes

```{r}
name <- "hello"
```
else R will look for a variable of that name 
```{r ,error=TRUE}
character <- hello
```
every ' must be closed by another ', as so does every ". don't mix the two.  
```{r ,error=TRUE}
character <- "hello'
```
This is useful if you need to store a string with double quotes in it, you can wrap it around single quotes to do so
```{r}
character <- '"Hi!", they said'
```

Alternatively we can use '\' to force R to treat the '"' as a normal character and ignore its special meaning. In programming this is known as "escaping".
```{r}
character <- "\"Hi!\", they said"
```

## Factors

Traditionally R has represented categorical variables as factors rather
than characters^[Both because of R's origin as a statistical language and because there was a memory advantage to storing strings as factors].
In factors each category (named level) is assigned an integer value.

We create factors by using the factor() function.
```{r}
colours <- factor(c("red","green","blue"))
```
note the `c()` syntax here creates a collection of elements
```{r}
colours
```

checking a factor mode and type reveals their underlying representation as integers 
```{r}
mode(colours)
typeof(colours)
```

historically R would automatically convert any character to factors, unless told not
to. From R 4.0 `read.table()` and `data.frame()` have stopped doing so.
Factors can be very useful for plotting and modeling, see [r for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html). 

But be careful! While some functions have special methods for dealing with factors, 
some treat factors as strings, other as numbers.

for instance the median function will correctly refuse to work on a factor but IQR will happily 
calculate an inter quantile range based on the integer value
```{r, error=T}
median(colours)
```
```{r}
IQR(colours)
```

# Functions 

We have seen functions before, these are commands you use to perform a specific action.
So far we have seen functions with one argument but functions can have multiple arguments separated by a comma.

For instance we can call sum to add some numbers
```{r}
sum(1, 3, 5, 7)
```

functions have often default values where there is no need to specify an argument 
unless we need a different value from the default

The sequence `seq` function needs only needs a start and an end
number to produce a sequence from 0 to 10
```{r}
seq(0,10)
```

We can replace the default increment of 1 with 2 by specifying `by = 2`
Think of it as assigning the value to a variable named `by` that will be passed to the function.
Note here we use `=` not `<-`.

```{r}
seq(0,10,by = 2)
```
We can even explicitly state the name of all the arguments to ignore their order, but avoid it as it become confusing.
```{r}
seq(by = 2, to = 10, from = 0)
```

The ability to specify argument names becomes useful when we want to leave some arguments in the middle as the default. 
If we relied on position alone there would be no way to do so.

Some functions do not require any arguments, either because they have all default arguments or don't need any. We must still add an empty `()`.
`getwd()` will return the working directory (i.e the folder R is currently opening -- which may be different from the folder your script is).
```{r}
getwd()
```
if you forget the `()`, R will print some information about the function itself, rather than calling it.
```{r}
getwd
```

## Setting the working directory 

We have seen `getwd()` will print the working directory to the screen.
to change the working directory we can use `setwd()`.  

### Notes on file paths 

Windows paths use `\`, but remember this has a special meaning in R so we can use `\` to tell r to escape^[Our new fancy way to say ignore] the special character. Hence, the path separator becomes `\\`
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("c:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials\\")
```
However R can use Linux/Mac style paths using `/`  on windows too.
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("c:/Users/username/Documents/Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials/")
```

Mac/Linux paths begin with a `/` rather than `letter:\`
for Macs^[Linux paths are similar but the home directory is usually under /home/user and the paths are usually case-sensitive so /home is not the same as /Home] the same locations should look like this
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("/username/home/Documents/Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials/")
```

Or we can use `~` to automatically get to our user home directory on Linux and Mac
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Documents/Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials/")
```

Windows has traditionally no concept of a home directory. But *in R on windows* `~` points to your document folder ^[Note: this is an R convention not necessarily shared by other software, python - another popular language for programming and data analysis refuses to recognise `~` on Windows. Other programs use `~` to  point to your user folder rather than your Document folder]

The paths above are known as absolute paths i.e they start from the first directory of your computer and make sense regardless of the current folder.
Alternatively we can use relative paths to point to a folder on the basis of where we are now. imagine we have a sub-folder named session 1.
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("session 1")
```

To help navigate relative paths remember `.` points to the current folder and 
`..` points to the folder above the current one.

## Help 

if you are ever stuck with a function adding ? before its name will open the help panel for you. The help panel will describe a function, its
arguments and defaults, often a summary of the methods used, and a usage example.

for instance, 
```{r}
?hist
```
returns

![help page for the hist (histogram) function](images/help_hist.PNG)

The information on these help panels can be very concise and confusing at first.
However, as you familiarize with R they will eventually make sense and become good as a quick reference
(i.e if you forgot the exact name of an argument, how is it formatted or what the function actually does).

## how do the sessions work. 

These workshop are in the spirit of the carpenteries [see their material here](https://carpentries.org/), 

During the tutorials you'll sometimes be asked to try something.
in this case the solution will be initially hidden. Try to come up with your answer
and run it to check the output before un hiding the code to check it

This is an example of hidden code 
```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}
print("hello world")
```
