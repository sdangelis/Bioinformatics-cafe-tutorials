title: "Setting up R and Rstudio"
---

before we can run R we need to install it. We'll also install Rstudio
This video shows how to install R and Rstudio on your pc/mac/linux 
[youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=by5HyJX6H1I)

If you are on a BCI IT managed windows machine you should be able to install R and R studio 
without needing admin access. A recent version of R studio is available in the software centre 
(downloading R studio from the internet requires admin access)
However, you will need to install R separately as the version on the software centre is not up to date.

Note this tutorial has been designed for R version 4 and higher.

## Introducing Rstudio

RStudio has 4 panels 
 
1. Editor. This is where you write your scripts 
2. Console. This is the command line interface where you can run R code, or where the code you select from the script with ctrl+enter (pc) / cmd+enter (mac) get sent to
3. environment pane. This is where the variables you create during the R session get displayed.
4. fourth pane. This is a panel of many functions, depending on the selected tab it can display the files in the working directory, any plots you produce, a list of packages and an help panel.

Within Rstudio there are 2 ways to interact with R. You can execute code from a script by selecting it and pressing ctrl+enter (pc) / cmd+enter (mac).  
This is the best way as the code you execute remains on the script and you can easily run multiple lines. Or you can type your command directly in the console. 

# Introducing R 

before the first session let's introduce some really basic concepts in R.

## Variables 

To save something in the computing memory we need to assign its value to a variables. 
In R Variables can be assigned using `name <- value`.

for instance we can create a variable to

```{r}
apples <- 1
```

R variable names must start with a letter but can then have letters, numbers and the speacial characters `.` or `_`

variables can contain spaces but using *SPACES IN VARIABLE NAMES IS A BAD IDEA*.
There are 2 ways to separate words within a name, `SnakeCase` and `camel_case`. `camel_case` is normally used in R.

This introduces the concept of style, which is how your code looks to someone else.
Style is a subjective matter, see the relevant section in the [reading](reading.Rmd) tab for links to some guides.
Try to find something you like and stick to it. Consistency helps avoid bugs and helps people understand your code.

we can surround an assignment with `()` to assign and print the values to the screen at the same time

```{r}
(n_samples <- 42)
```

Note: R will happily overwrite values in a variable without any warning

```{r}
n_samples <- 1
n_samples <- 2
n_samples 
```
### Listing and Removing Variables

We can remove variables with `rm(variable)`. i.e 
```{r}
rm(apples)
```

Although RStudio will list all variables in the environment panel, we can use ls() to list all the variables in the environment. Notice we have removed apples.
```{r}
ls()
```
combine it with rm to remove everything. *USE THIS WITH CARE*

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
```

## Data Modes 

Computers store all information in binary form as 0s and 1s. However, the exact way depends of the type of variable, for instance text is stored differently than numbers.
R is a dynamically typed language. In short there is no need to specify what type
a variable is - R does a pretty good job at figuring that automatically

There is normally no need to worry about type and chances are this is the most boring part of the workshops. Sometimes R gets types wrong and and things get horribly wrong so it pays off to understand how the type system works.

These are present - with different variations on the theme - in most if not all programming languages^[If you come from some other languages]. In the context of R data types are grouped into 4 main data modes, 
confusingly R variables can also have a type:

| Mode | type | content | Example | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| logical | logical | Boolean values or NA | NA |
| numeric | real |real | 1.3 |
| numeric | integer |integer| 1L |
| complex | complex |numbers | i+2i |
| character | character | letters and strings of text | "hello world" |

Note: in R all numbers are real unless we add the `L` suffix to specify an integer 

we can check the mode of a variable using `mode(variable)`
```{r}
mode(1L)
```
and the type with `typeof()`

```{r}
typeof(1L)
```

### Converting types

Sometimes R can convert or coerce types within a mode automatically,
We can also explicitly convert between types with one of the `as.type()` functions

```{r}
as.numeric("3")
```

Of course the value must make sense in the new type, else we get a `NA` which is R way to represent missing values.

```{r}
as.numeric("three")
```

### Characters

R characters contain one or more text characters. Sequences of characters are commonly called strings. 
To create a character we quote our text with either single '' or double "" quotes

```{r}
name <- "hello"
```
else R will look for a variable of that name 
```{r ,error=TRUE}
character <- hello
```
every ' must be closed by another ', as so does every ". don't mix the two.  
```{r ,error=TRUE}
character <- "hello'
```
This is useful if you need to store a string with double quotes in it, you can wrap it around single quotes to do so
```{r}
character <- '"Hi!", they said'
```

Alternatively we can use '\' to force R to treat the '"' as a normal character and ignore its special meaning. In programming this is known as "escaping".
```{r}
character <- "\"Hi!\", they said"
```


## Maths

maths operators in R work as expected
```{r}
2+2
```
```{r}
2-1
```
```{r}
1*5
```
```{r}
1/5
```
if we are interested in the integer part of a division we can use the integer division operator
```{r}
7%/%2
```
we can use the modulus operator `%%` to calculate the remainder
```{r}
7%%2
```
in R exponents are represented with `**` or `^`
```{r}
10**2
10^2
```
10ⁿ can be shortened to `en`
```{r}
1e2
```
Maths effortlessly works across all Numeric values. 
```{r}
1L+0.5
```
But of course characters don't make much sense in maths and return an error 
```{r error = T}
"3" - 3
```

## Functions and Arguments 

Functions are commands you use to perform a specific action. They follow the `name(argument1, argument2)` syntax  
For instance we can call `sum()` to add some numbers
```{r}
sum(1, 3, 5, 7)
```
In R we can specify argument by their position, or even a mix of both.

for instance we can use `seq` to get all the numbers from 1 to 10
```{r}
seq(1, 10)
```
We did not need, unless we want to use another increment, for instance 2.  
```{r}
seq(1, 10, 2)
```
Lots of positional arguments can become unreadable, so we would normally name the increment with `by = 2`.
Named arguments follow the `name = value` syntax. Think of it as an assignment but without `<-`.
```{r}
seq(0 ,10, by = 2)
```
Named arguments do not need to be in a specific order. We can name all arguments to completely swap their order.
Please avoid this as the resulting code becomes unecesarily confusing.
```{r}
seq(by = 2, to = 10, from = 0)
```
The ability to specify argument names becomes useful when we want to leave some arguments in the middle as the default. 
If we relied on position alone there would be no way to do so.

Some functions do not require any arguments, either because they have all default arguments or don't need any. We must still add an empty `()`.
`getwd()` will return the working directory (i.e the folder R is currently opening -- which may be different from the folder your script is).
```{r}
getwd()
```
if you forget the `()`, R will print some information about the function itself, rather than calling it.
```{r}
getwd
```

### Setting the working directory 

to change the working directory we can use `setwd()`.  

#### Notes on file paths 

Windows paths use `\`, but remember this has a special meaning in R so we can use `\` to tell r to ignore or escape^[Programmer's fancy way to say ignore] the special character. Hence, the path separator becomes `\\`
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("c:\\Users\\username\\Documents\\Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials\\")
```
However R can use Linux/Mac style paths using `/`  on windows too.
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("c:/Users/username/Documents/Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials/")
```
Mac/Linux paths begin with a `/` rather than `letter:\`
for Macs^[Linux paths are similar but the home directory is usually under /home/user and the paths are usually case-sensitive so /home is not the same as /Home] the same locations should look like this.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("/username/home/Documents/Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials/")
```
Or we can use `~` to automatically get to our user home directory on Linux and Mac.  
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Documents/Bioinformatics-cafe-tutorials/")
```
Windows has traditionally no concept of a home directory. But *in R on windows* `~` points to your document folder ^[Note: this is an R convention not necessarily shared by other software, python - another popular language refuses to recognize `~` on Windows. Other programs use `~` to  point to your user folder rather than your Document folder].  
The paths above are known as absolute paths i.e they start from the first directory of your computer and make sense regardless of the current folder.
Alternatively we can use relative paths to point to a folder on the basis of where we are now. imagine we have a sub-folder named `session_1`. We don't need to specify how to get to the main folder to get to it.
```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("session_1")
```
To help navigate relative paths remember:  
`.` points to the current folder  
`..` points to the folder above the current one.  
Note: if this is all too confusing^[No shame in doing this, it took me a while to be confident with paths] you can use R studio to choose a file. from the top bar go session > set working directory > Choose Directory.

# OPTIONAL READING - Functions, Passing by value and Duplicates

In R generally functions pass arguments by value. This means the functions gets a copy of the variable
and does not change  the value of the variable itself.

if we get the absolute value of a number with `abs` we don't change the value of the number in place 
```{r}
number = -9 
abs(number)
```
```{r}
number
```
to do so we need to manually reassign the variable 
```{r}
(number = abs(number))
```
Similarly, when set two variables to be the same, when we modify one R does not change the other.
For instance, let's have 3 apples and tell R that pears are the same as apples
```{r}
apples = 3 
pears = apples
```
if we now change apples
```{r}
apples = 1
```
apples change but pears will be the same
```{r}
apples 
pears
```
In short, R goes out of its way to prevent us from accidentally overwriting a value with the result of an operation on the value.
Keep in mind this is not the norm in programming ^[Most languages use a mix of passing by value - i.e the function gets a copy and passing by reference - i.e the function gets the address of the variable and works on that. In some cases both a copying and an in place version of a function are available as passing by value prevents accidental modifications but the copying required makes this approach slower than passing by reference].

*Note:* This is a simplified version of the full story.

# Help 

if you are ever stuck adding ? before a function name will open the help panel for you. you should^[How comprehensive the documentation depends on the author of the function so your mileage may vary] get a description of a function, its
arguments and defaults, often a summary of the methods used, and a usage example.  
for instance, 
```{r}
?hist
```
returns

![help page for the hist (histogram) function](images/help_hist.PNG)

The information on these help panels can be very concise and confusing at first.
However, as you familiarize with R they will eventually make sense and become good as a quick reference
(i.e if you forgot the exact name of an argument, how is it formatted or what the function actually does).

# how do the sessions work. 

These workshop are in the spirit of the carpenteries [see their material here](https://carpentries.org/),   
During the tutorials you'll sometimes be asked to try something.
In this case the solution will be initially hidden. Try to come up with your answer
and run it to check the output before un hiding the code to check it  

This is an example of hidden code 
```{r class.source = 'fold-hide'}
print("hello world")
```

# Data Files 

Once the tutorial is finalised, the data files for the 3 sessions will be available on Google Drive
